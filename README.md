# Challenge2
Challenge 2 for Nguyen and Thuc
Everything that we made is in the "master" branch
There is two folders. One is "Data" which is for the data obviously, and one is "Answer" which is for the answer of the exam.
index.py is the python file. 
In file "Answer", there is a file call "Answer.py" which helps the examiner to get the ans from the png. Luckily, we already got the Answer.csv for you.
